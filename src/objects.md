# Objects
An object is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
```js
nobu := {
    name: "Nobu",
    cool?: true,
    email: "nobu.bichanna@gmail.com",
}
```

Once you have an object, the properties contained can be accessed using the `.something` accessor syntax.
```js
nobu.cool? // true
```
