# Null And Empty

## Null
`null` is a keyword in Feo for literal values. It is a literal similar to `true` and `false`.
In Feo, `null` is a keyword much like the other keywords: `func`, `match`, or `and`.
It is just a value that shows that the object is referring to nothing.
```
null == null // => true
null <= 7.3  // => false
```

## Empty
`_` is an "empty" value, which is equal to anything.
```js
_ >= 123     // => true
_ == "hello" // => true
```
